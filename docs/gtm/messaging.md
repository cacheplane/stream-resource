# Messaging — ThreadPlane

> Operational doc. Hero copy, proof rows, comparison framing, launch lines. Edited by humans as we iterate. The durable category claim lives in [gtm.md §2](../../gtm.md).

## Positioning statement (durable)

> For Angular teams building AI agents on LangGraph, AG-UI, or custom backends, ThreadPlane is the open-source agent UI framework that turns streaming agent events into production-grade Angular experiences: chat, tool progress, approvals, threads, generative UI, fallbacks, observability, and tests. Unlike React-first agent UI stacks or raw streaming SDKs, ThreadPlane is signal-native, DI-friendly, design-system-first, self-hostable, and built for enterprise Angular apps.

## Hero (locked for Spec 2 to implement)

**H1:** Ship production agent UIs in Angular.

**Subhead:** Signal-native chat, threads, interrupts, tool progress, and generative UI for LangGraph, AG-UI, and A2UI. MIT-licensed, self-hostable, app telemetry off by default, no React rewrite.

**Primary CTA:** `Install @ngaf/chat` (copy-to-clipboard, fires `marketing:cta_click` with `cta_id=hero_install`, `track=developer`).

**Secondary CTA:** `Talk to our engineers` (routes to `/contact?source=home_hero&track=enterprise`, fires `marketing:cta_click` with `cta_id=hero_talk_to_engineers`, `track=enterprise`).

**Proof row:** `MIT · Angular-native Signals · LangGraph + AG-UI · A2UI-compatible · Self-hostable · App telemetry off by default`

**Subline under proof row:** *Not another backend agent runtime. Keep LangGraph, Genkit, Mastra, CrewAI, or your own service. ThreadPlane solves the Angular UI layer.*

## The five durable differentiation points

Repeat across the site, comparison pages, and content.

1. **Angular-native, not React-translated.** Signals, DI, OnPush, standalone components, Angular testing patterns, design-system ownership.
2. **Complete agent UI, not just stream plumbing.** Messages, status, errors, tool progress, interrupts, branching/history, thread persistence, reload, fallbacks, tests.
3. **Generative UI that respects the enterprise design system.** Approved components from your design system; no arbitrary code shipping.
4. **Enterprise OSS posture.** MIT, no app/runtime content telemetry by default, no required cloud, self-hosting, optional paid support/SLA.
5. **Production patterns, not demo candy.** Real auth, real backends, observability, error boundaries, fallback strategies, CI/CD, load/chaos patterns, runbooks.

## Risk-cleanup copy changes (Spec 2)

- "No telemetry" → "**App telemetry off by default**" with link to `libs/telemetry/README.md` for the minimal opt-out package install ping.
- "All Angular versions" (pricing) → **real compatibility matrix** with supported/experimental/planned/unsupported.
- "A2UI v1" → **"A2UI v0.9-compatible"** until v1 is verified.
- "Angular Agent Framework" → **"Agent UI for Angular"** (category sweep, with care for substring overlap per existing memory note).

## Contact page (Direction A.v2, locked)

**Headline:** Talk to an engineer.

**Subhead:** *Tell us what you're shipping. We'll reply within one business day — usually with code, not a calendar invite.*

**SLA card:** *Brian or someone on the team replies personally — from a real inbox, not `noreply@`. We read every message.*

**Alt-channel row (below form):** docs · GitHub issues · Discord.

**Trust signal:** GitHub star count pill. No logo wall.

**Fields:** email (required) + name, company, message (all optional). No stack dropdown, no company size, no "how did you hear." Optional fields feed enterprise-qualification when present.

Hidden attribution fields (populated by URL params + referrer): `source_page`, `track`, `cta_id`, `paper`, `referrer_host`.

## Comparison page framing (Spec 3)

| Alternative           | ThreadPlane positioning vs. them |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| `@langchain/angular`  | "Use it for the stream. Use ThreadPlane for the production Angular UI, design-system rendering, fallbacks, thread UX, testing, and enterprise patterns." |
| CopilotKit            | "Broad agent frontend stack; ThreadPlane is deeply Angular-native, signal/DI/design-system-first, optimized for enterprise Angular teams that don't want a React-first mental model." |
| Hashbrown             | "Hashbrown is great for browser-running agents and LLM-driven frontend tools; ThreadPlane is for LangGraph/AG-UI/A2UI-backed enterprise agent workflows with production chat, approvals, threads, observability, and runtime adapters." |
| A2UI renderer         | "A2UI renderer support is table stakes; ThreadPlane adds Angular app integration, fallback behavior, design-system registry patterns, thread/chat UX, and enterprise hardening." |

## Launch narrative (Spec 6 spine)

> Angular teams are building agents, but the last mile is still messy: streaming state, tool progress, interrupts, threads, generated UI, fallbacks, and tests. React has mature examples. Backend agent frameworks have protocols. Angular teams need something that speaks Signals, DI, templates, standalone components, and enterprise design systems. ThreadPlane is an MIT-licensed agent UI framework for Angular that connects LangGraph, AG-UI, A2UI, and custom backends to production-ready Angular surfaces.

## Avoid

- "The Angular Agent Framework for LangChain." (Competes directly with `@langchain/angular`; narrows the story.)
- "Enterprise Angular agent framework." (Reads sales-first.)
- "We're building the React of Angular agents." (Doesn't land for our buyer.)
- Logo walls of unrelated F500s on the contact page.
- Progressive multi-step qualification forms.
