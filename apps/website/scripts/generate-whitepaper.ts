Chapter topic: Streaming State Management

Context: Angular teams building LangGraph-powered agents must wire SSE event streams into reactive UI. Without the right primitives, they end up with custom zone-patching, manual subscription management, and brittle token accumulation logic that breaks under load.

Cover:
- Why streaming state is hard in Angular (zone.js, change detection, timing)
- The signals-native approach: how streamResource() exposes messages() as Signal<AIMessage[]>
- How isStreaming() lets developers drive loading UI without polling
- Code example: minimal streamResource() setup (TypeScript snippet, 8-12 lines)
- Production checklist item: "Are your message signals OnPush-compatible?"

Chapter topic: Thread Persistence

Context: Demos work with ephemeral state. Production agents need conversation history that survives page refreshes, tab switches, and navigation — wired to LangGraph's MemorySaver backend.

Cover:
- Why stateless agent UIs fail in production
- The threadId signal and onThreadId callback pattern
- How to persist threadId to localStorage and restore on mount

Chapter topic: Tool-Call Rendering

Context: LangGraph agents invoke tools mid-stream. The UI needs to show tool execution state in real time — steps appearing as the tool runs, a final result, and collapsible history — without parsing raw SSE events by hand.

Cover:
- What tool call events look like in the raw stream
- Why hand-parsing is fragile and hard to test
- The <chat-tool-calls> headless primitive and <chat-tool-call-card> prebuilt option
- Progressive disclosure: showing steps live, collapsing on completion
- Code example: <chat-tool-call-card> binding (8-12 lines of Angular template)

Chapter topic: Human Approval Flows (Interrupts)

Context: Production agents that take consequential actions — sending emails, deploying services, modifying data — must pause for human approval before proceeding. This requires a tight loop between LangGraph's interrupt() primitive and Angular UI.

Cover:
- The LangGraph interrupt() and Command.RESUME pattern
- Why polling and custom websocket approaches are brittle
- The interrupt() signal in streamResource() and how it maps to approval state
- <chat-interrupt> headless and <chat-interrupt-panel> prebuilt
- The three approval actions: approve, edit, cancel — and how each maps to a resume command
- Code example: interrupt signal binding (8-12 lines)

Chapter topic: Generative UI

Context: The most advanced production agents emit structured UI specs — not just text. A data analysis agent might render a live table. A booking agent might render a reservation form. Without a framework for this, teams either hardcode component logic into the agent or skip the feature entirely.

Cover:
- The onCustomEvent pattern in LangGraph: how agents emit structured data
- The @ngaf/render approach: json-render specs, defineAngularRegistry(), <render-spec>
- How JSON patch streaming enables progressive UI updates (rows appearing as data arrives)
- The registry pattern: decoupling agent from component implementation
- Code example: defineAngularRegistry() registration (8-12 lines)

Chapter topic: Deterministic Testing

Context: Agent UIs are notoriously hard to test because they depend on live LLM responses. Flaky tests, slow CI, and inability to reproduce edge cases are the main reasons agent UIs ship with low confidence.

Cover:
- Why testing agent components against real LLM APIs is impractical
- The MockStreamTransport approach: scripted event sequences, no server needed
- createMockStreamResourceRef(): writable signals you control directly in tests
- How to test streaming, interrupts, tool calls, and generative UI in isolation
- Code example: createMockStreamResourceRef() test pattern (10-14 lines)

Chapter topic: The Last-Mile Problem

Context: Teams have built powerful LangGraph backends with sophisticated agent graphs, tool calling, and memory. Then they hit Angular. SSE streams don't integrate cleanly with zone.js. Signals and change detection are at odds with streaming event sequences. The backend works — the frontend gap is real and expensive.

Cover:
- Why SSE + Angular zones is a zone pollution problem, not a configuration problem
- How token streaming conflicts with Angular's synchronous change detection model
- The signal reactivity mismatch: LLM streams are push-based, Angular templates expect pull
- Why existing RxJS patterns from REST don't translate to streaming agent responses
- The cost: teams building custom zone-patch wrappers, token accumulators, and error retry logic from scratch on every project

Chapter topic: The agent() API

Context: @ngaf/langgraph exposes a signal-native API for streaming LangGraph agents into Angular components. The core primitive is agent() — a function that returns reactive signals wired directly to the agent stream, with no manual subscription management, no zone-patching, and no token accumulation logic.

Cover:
- How agent() returns a structured ref with typed signals: messages(), isStreaming(), error(), interrupt()
- The provideAgent() provider and how it configures the agent endpoint and stream transport
- Why the signal-native design works with OnPush change detection out of the box
- How to bind agent state directly in Angular templates without async pipe or manual subscriptions
- Code example: minimal agent() setup with template binding (10-14 lines)

Chapter topic: Thread Persistence & Memory

Context: Production agent applications are stateful across sessions. Users expect to return to a conversation where they left off. This requires coordinating LangGraph's MemorySaver backend with a frontend that can persist, restore, and switch between threads.

Cover:
- The threadId signal: how it flows from LangGraph's checkpoint system to the Angular frontend
- Persisting threadId to localStorage on creation via the onThreadId callback
- Restoring thread state on component mount: initialThreadId input and what it triggers
- Building a thread list UI: listing stored thread IDs, switching active thread, clearing history
- How LangGraph MemorySaver maps to the frontend thread lifecycle
- Code example: provideAgent() with thread persistence pattern (8-12 lines)

Chapter topic: Interrupt & Approval Flows

Context: Agents that take real-world actions — sending emails, executing queries, modifying records — must pause for human confirmation. LangGraph's interrupt() primitive enables this on the backend. @ngaf/langgraph surfaces it as a reactive signal, eliminating the need for polling, websockets, or custom resume endpoints.

Cover:
- How LangGraph interrupt() pauses graph execution and what the resume payload looks like
- The interrupt() signal in the agent ref: how it transitions from null to an InterruptState object
- Command.RESUME and how the three actions (approve, edit, cancel) each map to different resume payloads
- The <chat-interrupt-panel> prebuilt: approval UI out of the box, no template work needed
- Handling the edge cases: user navigates away mid-interrupt, session expires, cancel with partial state
- Code example: interrupt signal binding with approve/cancel handlers (8-12 lines)

Chapter topic: Full LangGraph Feature Coverage

Context: Most Angular LLM integrations support basic chat. @ngaf/langgraph is designed for the full LangGraph feature surface: tool calls, subgraphs, time travel, and DeepAgent multi-agent coordination. Teams shouldn't have to drop down to raw SSE parsing to access advanced graph features.

Cover:
- Tool call streaming: how tool invocation events surface through the agent ref without manual parsing
- Subgraph support: how nested graph events bubble through the stream and into Angular signals
- Time travel: rewinding graph state to a prior checkpoint and re-streaming from that point
- DeepAgent: what multi-agent coordination looks like at the stream level and how it maps to Angular signals
- The onCustomEvent hook: consuming structured non-message agent output (for generative UI, analytics, etc.)
- Why full coverage matters: avoiding the pattern where teams bypass the library for advanced features

Chapter topic: Deterministic Testing

Context: Angular component tests for agent UIs are only useful if they run fast, offline, and deterministically. Real LLM calls in tests mean slow CI, flaky outcomes, and inability to reproduce specific edge cases like interrupted streams or tool call errors.

Cover:
- MockStreamTransport: scripting a deterministic sequence of SSE events without a server
- createMockStreamResourceRef(): directly controlling signal values in Angular component tests
- How to test each agent state: streaming in progress, stream complete, interrupt pending, error state
- Testing tool call rendering, generative UI output, and thread switching in isolation
- TestBed setup with MockStreamTransport (8-12 lines)

Chapter topic: The Coupling Problem

Context: When agents emit structured output that needs to become UI, the naive approach is to hardcode the mapping in the frontend: inspect the agent output, switch on a type field, render a component. This works for demos. In production, it means every agent capability change requires a frontend deploy, component library changes leak into agent prompts, and iteration speed collapses.

Cover:
- The antipattern: ngSwitch on agent output type hardcoded in every consuming component
- Why this creates a bidirectional dependency between agent logic and frontend implementation
- The real cost: frontend engineers become blockers on every agent capability change
- How this pattern breaks at scale — multiple agents, multiple frontends, multiple teams
- What a decoupled architecture looks like: agents emit UI specs, frontends interpret them

Chapter topic: Declarative UI Specs & the json-render Standard

Context: Vercel's json-render spec defines a framework-agnostic standard for describing UI as structured JSON. An agent emits a json-render document. A frontend interprets it. Neither side knows how the other is implemented. @ngaf/render implements this standard for Angular, with streaming JSON patch support on top.

Cover:
- What a json-render document looks like: component name, props, children (concrete example)
- Why an open standard matters: portability across frameworks, LLM prompt stability, community tooling
- How the spec handles conditional rendering, iteration, and computed properties
- Google's A2UI spec and how it extends json-render for agent-specific patterns
- The @ngaf/render implementation: <render-spec> directive consumes a json-render document

Chapter topic: The Component Registry

Context: A json-render document references components by name. The registry is what maps those names to actual Angular components. defineAngularRegistry() is the @ngaf/render API for declaring this mapping — it's the seam between the open standard and your specific component library.

Cover:
- How defineAngularRegistry() maps string component names to Angular component classes
- Providing the registry via provideRenderRegistry() for dependency injection
- The <render-spec> directive: how it resolves component names at render time
- Input mapping: how json-render props become Angular @Input() bindings
- Handling unknown component names: fallback rendering and error boundaries
- Code example: defineAngularRegistry() with 3-4 registered components (10-14 lines)

Chapter topic: Streaming JSON Patches

Context: Generative UI is most powerful when it streams. A data table with 50 rows should appear progressively — rows rendering as the agent produces them, not after a 3-second wait for the full JSON payload. @ngaf/render uses JSON Patch (RFC 6902) to apply incremental updates to the UI spec as it streams, enabling skeleton states and progressive rendering.

Cover:
- Why streaming full JSON documents on each update is impractical for large UI specs
- JSON Patch RFC 6902: add, replace, remove operations on a JSON document
- How the agent emits patch operations instead of full spec replacements
- Partial-JSON parsing: rendering valid portions of an incomplete JSON stream
- Skeleton states: how to show placeholder UI while the spec is still arriving
- Code example: consuming streaming patch events in a @ngaf/render component (8-12 lines)

Chapter topic: State Management & Computed Functions

Context: Static UI specs only go so far. Production generative UI needs computed properties — values derived from other spec fields — and repeat loops for rendering collections. @ngaf/render's signalStateStore() and computed function support bring dynamic behavior into the spec without requiring custom component logic.

Cover:
- signalStateStore(): agent-managed state that components can read and update
- Computed properties in the json-render spec: expressions evaluated at render time
- Repeat loops: iterating over spec arrays to render collections of components
- How computed functions let agents define derived UI state declaratively
- The boundary between spec-level logic and component-level logic — where to draw the line
- Code example: signalStateStore() with computed properties in a spec (8-12 lines)

Chapter topic: The Sprint Tax

Context: Every team building an Angular agent application eventually builds the same chat UI from scratch: message list, input box, streaming token display, auto-scroll, loading states, error handling. It takes 4-6 weeks. Then they iterate on it for another 4-6 weeks. Meanwhile, the agent backend is ready and waiting.

Cover:
- The inventory of things every chat UI needs: message rendering, streaming display, tool call cards, interrupt panels, auto-scroll, accessibility, mobile layout
- Why building this from scratch on every project is a structural inefficiency, not a skill gap
- The hidden costs: accessibility is harder than it looks, streaming token display has edge cases, tool call state machines are complex
- What "good enough for demo" looks like vs. what production chat UI actually requires
- The opportunity cost: senior Angular engineers spending sprints on chat chrome instead of agent integration

Cover:
- The headless tier: chat-messages, chat-input, chat-tool-calls, chat-interrupt — behavior without styling
- The prebuilt tier: chat-prebuilt — a full chat interface in one component, zero configuration
- How the two tiers compose: using prebuilt for 90% of UI, dropping to headless for custom sections
- The component model: how @ngaf/chat connects to the agent ref from @ngaf/langgraph

Context: Chat UI that looks like a generic chatbot is a product liability. Enterprise teams need chat components that match their design system — typography, color palette, border radius, spacing. @ngaf/chat uses CSS custom properties and design tokens to make this integration straightforward without requiring component source access.

Cover:
- The CSS custom property API: how @ngaf/chat exposes design decisions as variables
- Design token mapping: aligning chat component tokens with your existing design system tokens
- Typography integration: font family, size scale, and line height control
- Color system integration: surface colors, text colors, accent colors, and semantic state colors

Context: Debugging agent chat is hard. The message stream is opaque, tool call state transitions are fast, and interrupt flows have timing edge cases. chat-debug is @ngaf/chat's built-in debug panel — a developer overlay that surfaces agent state, raw message events, tool call history, and interrupt state in real time.

Cover:
- What chat-debug shows: raw AIMessage[] state, streaming event log, tool call state machine, interrupt payload
- How to add chat-debug to any chat interface: one component, zero configuration in dev mode
- Inspecting individual messages: expanding message content, viewing message type and metadata
