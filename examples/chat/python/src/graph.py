"""Single-node-plus-tools streaming chat graph.

State the client may send via the LangGraph ``submit``'s ``state`` field:

  - ``model`` — OpenAI model name. Default: ``gpt-5-mini``.
  - ``reasoning_effort`` — 'minimal' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'.
                           Default: 'minimal' so first-token latency
                           stays low. Demos surface this as a palette
                           dropdown so users can dial in visible reasoning.

Topology:

  __start__ → generate ─┬─ [has tool_calls] ─→ tools ─→ generate (loop)
                        └─ [no tool_calls]  ─→ attach_citations ─→ __end__

The terminal ``attach_citations`` node walks back from the final AI
message to the most recent ToolMessage, parses its JSON content, and
replaces the AI message with one carrying ``additional_kwargs.citations``
populated. Uses RemoveMessage + AIMessage with the same id (standard
LangGraph in-place edit pattern), keeping the chat composition's
track-by-id stable.
