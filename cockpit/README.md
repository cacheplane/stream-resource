# Cockpit Module Contract

The `cockpit/` tree is product-first by design.

- product-first roots:
  - `cockpit/deep-agents/<capability>/<language>`
  - `cockpit/langgraph/<capability>/<language>`
- canonical identity stays aligned with the registry:
  - `product / section / topic / page / language`
- capability modules own runtime adapters and metadata
- docs-only entries stay in the shared manifest and website docs system

Every capability module should make the mapping between its product-first directory and the canonical registry identity explicit.

## E2E Coverage

Runnable cockpit Playwright specs live under `cockpit/<product>/<capability>/angular/e2e/` only when the Angular project has an Nx `e2e` target with its own Playwright config, setup, and fixtures. Historical exploratory checks that are not wired into Nx live under `e2e/manual/` with a `.manual.ts` suffix until they are promoted to a configured target-backed suite.
